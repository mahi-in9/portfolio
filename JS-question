✅ Real-World + Code Questions

What will be the output?

console.log([] + []); 
console.log([] + {}); 
console.log({} + []);


What is the output?

console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);


What will this print?

let a = {x: 1};
let b = a;
b.x = 2;
console.log(a.x);


What happens here?

const a = [1, 2, 3];
const b = a;
b.push(4);
console.log(a);

Implement a custom debounce() function.

Implement a custom throttle() function.

Implement a custom Promise.all() polyfill.

Implement your own bind(), call(), and apply().

How would you implement memoization manually?

How would you implement a LRU cache in JS?

What is the difference between deep equality (==) and reference equality (===) for objects?

How does event loop behave with setTimeout, Promise, and async/await in one code block?

What is the output order of:

console.log('A');
