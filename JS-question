Core JavaScript (Beginner to Intermediate)

These check your foundation — syntax, basics, and core behavior.

✅ Basics & Syntax

~ What are the different data types in JavaScript?

<!-- In Js there are two types of data types
    1) Premitive data types: premitive are imuttable and are stored by value
        7 types of premitive data types: string, bigInt, number, boolean, null, undefined, sybmbol
    2) Non-premitive data types: non-premitive are mutable and are stored by reference
     ex: Object, array and function
     -->

~ Difference between var, let, and const.

<!-- we can differenciate var let and const by many types:
1) declaration: var can be re-declared and updated in the same scope.
& let and const cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

2) Initialization: var and let can be declare without assigning an initial value,
const must be initialize at the time of declaration.

3) scope: var is functional scope,
let and const are block scope;

4) hoisting: all three ae hosited but they behave differently
var is hoisted with and initialize with undefined,
let and const are hoisted but remain in the TDZ. until their declaration line
 -->

~ What is hoisting? Give examples.

<!-- Hoisting is a javascript mechanism where all the function and variable declaration are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.
Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized as undefined, while let and const are hoisted but remain in the Temporal Dead Zone.
Function declarations are fully hoisted, allowing them to be called before definition
 -->

~ What are template literals?

<!-- Template literals, introduced in ES6, provide a cleaner and more powerful way to handle strings using backticks. They support string interpolation (${}), multi-line strings, and expression embedding, replacing complex string concatenation and improving readability.
 -->

~ Explain the difference between == and ===.

<!--
The == operator checks equality after performing type coercion, meaning it converts operands to the same type before comparison.
The === operator, known as strict equality, checks both type and value, making it more predictable and recommended for most comparisons in modern JavaScript.
 -->

~ What are truthy and falsy values in JS?

<!--These are the only values considered falsy:
false
0
-0
"" (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN

Any value not listed above is truthy, including:

Non-empty strings → "Mahi"

Non-zero numbers → 42, -7

Objects and arrays → {}, []

Functions → function() {}
 -->

~ What is the difference between undefined, null, and NaN?

~ What is the typeof operator used for?

~ What is the output of typeof null? Why?

~ What are primitive and non-primitive data types?

⚙️ Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript

These questions focus on execution, async, prototypes, and browser internals.

✅ Execution & Event Loop

<!-- Explain the JavaScript Execution Context. -->

<!-- What are Creation Phase and Execution Phase? -->

<!-- What is the Call Stack? -->

<!-- What is the Event Loop, and how does it work? -->

<!-- Explain Microtasks vs Macrotasks (Promises vs setTimeout). -->

<!-- What is the order of execution in async JS code? -->

<!-- What is the difference between process.nextTick() and Promise.then()? -->

✅ Prototype & OOP in JS

<!-- What is a prototype chain? -->

<!-- What is prototypal inheritance? -->

<!-- How do you create classes in JS (ES5 vs ES6)? -->

<!-- What are getters and setters in a class? -->

<!-- Difference between static and instance methods? -->

<!-- What does super() do in class constructors? -->

<!-- Can you inherit from multiple classes in JS? -->

✅ Asynchronous JavaScript

<!-- Difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming. -->

<!-- What are Promises? -->

<!-- What are async/await keywords, and how do they work internally? -->

<!-- What is Promise.all, Promise.allSettled, Promise.any, and Promise.race? -->

<!-- How do you handle errors in async/await? -->

<!-- What is the difference between callback hell and promise chaining? -->

<!-- What is the fetch() API, and how does it differ from XMLHttpRequest? -->

<!-- How can you cancel a fetch request? -->

✅ DOM & Browser APIs

<!-- What is the DOM? -->

<!-- Difference between NodeList and HTMLCollection? -->

<!-- What are event bubbling and capturing? -->

<!-- How do you prevent event propagation? -->

What is debouncing and throttling?
<!-- 
Debouncing are throttling both are used to optimatization of an app but they both worked differnetly
we use debouncing to get result after the certain time period when action are being stopped.
and on other hand we use throttling 
 -->

What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent?

<!--
innerHTML, innerText, and textContent are used to get or set the content of a DOM element, but they work differently:

innerHTML returns or sets the HTML markup inside an element. It parses HTML tags, so it can add or remove elements dynamically.
Example: div.innerHTML = "<b>Hello</b>" renders bold text.

innerText returns only the visible text of an element as displayed on the page, respecting CSS styles like display: none or visibility: hidden.
Example: It ignores hidden elements.

textContent returns the raw text of an element and its children, ignoring any HTML tags and CSS styles. It’s faster and safer for inserting plain text because it doesn’t parse HTML.
 -->

How do you dynamically create and append elements in the DOM?

<!--We can dynamically create elements in the DOM using document.createElement() and then insert them using methods like appendChild() or append().
Before appending, we can modify the element’s content, attributes, and styles.
appendChild() adds a single node, while append() can add multiple nodes
 -->

What is localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies?

<!--
localStorage and sessionStorage are part of the Web Storage API used for storing key–value pairs in the browser, while cookies are used mainly for server–client communication.
localStorage persists even after the browser closes, sessionStorage lasts only for a tab session, and cookies can have a custom expiry date and are automatically sent with HTTP requests
 -->

Difference between DOMContentLoaded and load events?

<!--
DOMContentLoaded fires when the HTML document is completely parsed and the DOM is ready, without waiting for external resources.
load fires only after the entire page — including all assets — has fully loaded.
Use DOMContentLoaded for initializing scripts that manipulate the DOM early, and load for tasks that require all resources to be available.
 -->

What is the Shadow DOM?

<!--
The Shadow DOM is a browser feature that lets you create encapsulated DOM trees with their own scoped styles and markup. It prevents style and behavior conflicts across components, enabling better modularity and reusability in web applications.
